-Proxy:
	A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet.
        Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network.
        It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.

-Reverse Proxy:
	A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client (e.g. web browser)
 	requests to those web servers.
	Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase security, performance, and reliability.
